# Foundations

All people deserve access to clear, accurate information about disability—framed by disabled people's expertise and grounded in rights-based frameworks. This section provides the essential concepts, language, and models that shape the entire wiki.

---

## Why This Matters

How we understand disability shapes everything: policy, healthcare, education, employment, relationships, and self-perception. Many disabled people encounter conflicting definitions, outdated terminology, and frameworks that treat disability as tragedy or burden. This section offers alternatives grounded in disabled people's own knowledge and organizing.

Whether you're newly disabled, supporting someone who is, researching for professional work, or deepening your understanding, these pages build shared vocabulary and explain why frameworks matter.
