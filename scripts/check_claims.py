"""Claim-integrity checker for disabilitywiki.org.

Adapted in spirit from the Langworthywatch fact-check validator. That tool
validates that *verification happened* rather than trying to adjudicate truth:
it checks a Sources section exists, that external URLs have archive backups,
and that the claims-to-sources ratio is sane.

This wiki's structure differs. Reference pages don't carry per-page Sources
sections; verification lives centrally in docs/CLAIMS.md. So the analog is:

  their per-page Sources section  ->  our CLAIMS.md ledger
  their archive.org backup check  ->  our archive column + org URL liveness
  their claims regex              ->  same idea, load-bearing figure detection
  their credibility score         ->  our ledger coverage score

Plus one check their domain doesn't need: a REGRESSION GUARD. A verification
pass that rejects a claim produces knowledge that is otherwise lost the moment
the session ends. Six months later the same bad source gets re-imported and the
same wrong number ships again. Rejected claims are recorded in CLAIMS.md and
this script fails the build if one reappears.

Exit codes:
    0  no blocking problems
    1  a rejected claim reappeared in published content (blocking)
    2  bad invocation / ledger unparseable

Advisory findings (stale rows, unledgered figures, dead org URLs) report but
do not block, matching how check_accessibility.py already behaves.
