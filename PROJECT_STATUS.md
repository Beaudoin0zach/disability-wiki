## 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Anonymous GitHub Setup (30 minutes)
- [ ] Create ProtonMail account
- [ ] Create anonymous GitHub account
- [ ] Create public repository
- [ ] Push initial commit
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings

### 2. Manual Collection Phase (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Collect 10-15 strongest examples of contradictions
- [ ] Document verification process for each
- [ ] Create fact-check entries using template
- [ ] Perfect methodology
- [ ] Get trusted reviewers to check accuracy

### 3. Domain Purchase (Optional - $12)
- [ ] Buy domain with privacy protection
- [ ] Configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Update baseURL in hugo.toml
- [ ] Enable HTTPS enforcement

### 4. Soft Launch (Week 5)
- [ ] Publish first 10 entries
- [ ] Share anonymously on r/Buffalo
- [ ] Post in WNY political groups
- [ ] Send to local journalists as resource
- [ ] Monitor response

### 5. Automation (Later - if sustainable)
- [ ] Build Python scraper for press releases
- [ ] Add voting record cross-reference
- [ ] Set up keyword flagging system
- [ ] Create submission form for constituents

## 💰 Total Cost

**Current**: $0
**With domain**: $12/year
**Optional upgrades**: $0-10/month for enhanced hosting (not needed initially)

## 🔒 Anonymity Safeguards

- Separate GitHub account with ProtonMail
- Domain with privacy protection
- No identifying information in content
- Version-controlled for transparency
- Can claim ownership later when appropriate

## 📝 Content Standards

Every entry must have:
1. Exact quote with date
2. Primary source link (congress.gov, official sites)
3. Archive.org archived URL
4. Screenshot saved locally
5. Full context provided
6. No opinion or speculation

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/zachbeaudoin/Langworthywatch/langworthy-tracker

# Create new fact-check entry
hugo new content/fact-checks/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md

# Test locally
hugo server -D
# Then visit http://localhost:1313

# Publish changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new fact-check entry"
git push  # Auto-deploys via GitHub Actions
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Start manually**: Don't build automation until you've proven the concept
2. **Quality over quantity**: 1-2 solid entries per week beats rushed daily posts
3. **Accuracy is everything**: One error undermines entire project
4. **Stay factual**: No analysis, just documented facts side-by-side
5. **Keep it separate**: Never mention on personal/business accounts

## 🎓 Your Advantages

- Policy research training (CSU/Columbia MA)
- CPACC certification shows attention to standards

## 📊 Metrics to Track (Optional)

- Number of entries published
- Page views (via GitHub Pages insights or Plausible)
- Social shares

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly** (2-3 hours):
- Monday: Check sources for new material

- Friday: Write entry, publish

**Monthly**:
- Review all archive links still working
- Check for any errors to correct
- Update if new information emerges
