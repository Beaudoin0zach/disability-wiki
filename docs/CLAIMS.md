# Canonical Claims Ledger

**Purpose.** One registry for the wiki's **load-bearing facts** — the numbers,
deadlines, and rules a reader would *act on*, where being wrong causes real harm.
Each row pins a claim to a **primary source** and a **verification date**. When the
accuracy or slop skills correct something, record it here so the same figure isn't
re-litigated from scratch next sweep.

Adapted from the `public-ledger` `CLAIMS.md` discipline. It is the content analog
of that project's "single source of truth for headline numbers."

**Why it exists.** The fact-check error heatmap (project memory) shows the wiki's
errors cluster in exactly the claim types below: **crisis hotline numbers**
(fabricated "Lifeline {Country}" orgs), **cross-jurisdiction legal detail**, and
**procedural deadlines**, plus **unsourced load-bearing statistics**. Those last
ones usually have a *real* source (Ruderman 2016, LeDeR, etc.) that got mangled or
dropped — the fix is attribution, not deletion. This ledger is where attribution
lives.

## How to use it

- **Cite from here.** Audit docs, the accuracy skill, and translations should
  treat a ✅ row as settled and pull the source from this table.
- **One claim per row.** Keep the metric exact and the source a *primary* one (the
  operating org, the statute, the agency rule), not a secondary explainer.
- **Fix EN and `es/` together.** A corrected number lives in two files; note both.
- **Grep before closing.** Load-bearing numbers propagate across overview/country
  pages and footers — confirm sitewide (`grep -rn "<value>" . --include=*.md`).
- **Archive, don't delete.** If a claim is corrected, move the old value to
  *Corrected / archived* with the reason — never silently overwrite history.

**Status legend:** ✅ verified against primary source · ⬜ to-verify · ⚠️ disputed /
needs re-check · 🗄️ archived (superseded).

## Crisis & hotline numbers (SEV1 — life-safety)

Highest-stakes rows. A wrong number here is a [SEV1 incident](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md).
Numbers below were corrected in the 2026-06 crisis audits (commits `78b2ed3`,
`7328e33`; tracked in `translation-source-accuracy-flags.md`) and synced to `es/`.
**Re-verify against the operating org annually** — hotlines change numbers/hours.

## Benefits figures (US)

| Page | Claim | Value | Primary source | Verified | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| benefits/us/ssi | SSI is **not** taxable income | not taxable | SSA | 2026-06 | ✅ (was wrongly "taxed as federal income assistance") |

| benefits/us/ssi | General income exclusion | first **$20/month** of most income | SSA | 2026-06 | ✅ (corrected the "gifts" myth) |
| benefits/us/ssi | Vehicle exclusion | one vehicle excluded regardless of value | SSA | 2026-06 | ✅ (corrected "car up to a certain value"; had propagated to benefits/index) |

## Legal rules & deadlines (cross-jurisdiction — heatmap hot zone)

| Page | Claim | Value | Primary source | Verified | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rights/us/ada | ADA Title II — **no punitive damages** vs government | unavailable | *Barnes v. Gorman* (2002) | 2026-06 | ✅ (fixed in es/; EN reconciliation pending per translation memo) |
| rights/.../idea | IDEA complaint deadlines | **1 yr** state complaint / **2 yr** due process | IDEA / 34 CFR | 2026-06 | ✅ (a page had wrongly used 180 days and routed IDEA to OCR) |
| rights/.../section-504 | OCR (§504 / Title II) complaint deadline | **180 days** | US ED OCR | 2026-06 | ✅ (distinct from IDEA above — do not conflate) |
| rights/us/ada | §503 vs §504 | distinct authorities | distinguish OFCCP §503 from §504 | — | ⬜ (known conflation hot spot — spot-check) |

## History & political economy (verified 2026-07-18)

Load-bearing figures from two external research briefs, verified before drafting.
Five parallel verification passes; **nothing was wholesale fabricated, but 5 claims
had no locatable source, 4 were materially outdated, and 1 was inverted.** The briefs'
own confidence labels understated the problem in several places.

### Verified — safe to cite

### ⚠️ Do not publish — no locatable source

| Claim (as asserted in brief) | Finding |
|---|---|
| UK's last iron lung user died 2017 (Guardian) | No source found in four search formulations. Likely conflation with the 2017 US count of three, or the UK's last polio paralysis case (1984). |
| Cuba — 447,600 disabled people | Untraceable. Sourced figure is **366,864** (*Por la Vida*, 2003). |
| England — 306,000 receiving relief in 1776 | Unverifiable. (The ~90,000 workhouse places figure *is* sound.) |
| 14(c) workers earning under **$3.40/hr** | Not a real figure. GAO: most under **$3.50**; USCCR cited **$3.34** average. |
| Medicare Advantage NIV denial rates "86% and 64%" | No locatable primary source. Traces to AAHomecare trade-association intake via HME News; plans unnamed, no denominator. Other MA plans reported in the low teens. |

### 🗄️ Outdated — brief is stale, do not repeat

| Claim (as asserted) | Current reality | Source |
|---|---|---|
| DOL 14(c) phase-out rulemaking pending | **WITHDRAWN 2025-07-07.** DOL concluded it lacks statutory authority (§14(c) says the Secretary "shall" issue certificates). No federal rulemaking pending; certificates still issued. | 90 FR doc. 2025-12534 |
| 14(c) worker count ~67,000 (2022) | **~40,000** (Nov 2024) | GAO |
| WHO targets: WPV1 certification 2027, cVDPV2 2029 | **44th Emergency Committee (2026-03-04)** re-set to interrupt WPV1 in **2026**, stop cVDPV2 by **2028**; certification now **undated** | WHO EC 44 |
| ~13 WPV1 cases mid-2025 | **2025 final: 52** (Afg 21 / Pak 31). **2026 YTD: 14** (Afg 11 / Pak 3) — burden has inverted, Afghanistan now leads | GPEI Polio This Week, 2026-07-15 |
| DMEPOS competitive bidding in indefinite gap | Gap real, but **Round 2028 announced** in the CY2026 final rule — bidding late 2026, program start **2028-01-01** | CMS CY2026 final rule |
| 75/25 blended rate fight ongoing (H.R. 5555 / S. 1294) | **Rate EXPIRED**, reverted 2024-01-01, not reinstated | CMS |

### ⚠️ Single-source — attribute in text, never assert

| Claim | Why |
|---|---|
| "There are no invalids in the USSR!" | Every chain ends at Fefelov's 1986 émigré memoir. **No named official, no contemporaneous record.** Retellings disagree on whether the official was asked about hosting or attending. Correct dating is **1980**. Cite Fefelov as disabled-authored origin, Phillips (2009) as scholarly vector. |
| ~~Soviet 1968 ban on integrated employment~~ | **CONTRADICTED as generally stated — do not publish.** See the dedicated row below. |
| Degener "human catastrophe" / Langvad "most challenging exercise" | Both from the **Aug 2017** Geneva examination, not the 2016 publication. Langvad's line traces to a single advocacy press release. |
| South Africa 6-vs-12-month grant differential | One working paper citing one 1992 clinical article. Operative law was **Disability Grants Act 27 of 1968**, so citing Act 36 of 1946 is anachronistic. |

### 🗄️ Resolved: there was no 1968 Soviet ban on integrated employment

Traced to source via a Wayback capture of Phillips (2009). **The claim is an
over-generalization Phillips makes of her own narrower, sourced statement**, and it
should not appear on the wiki in the broad form.

- Phillips's supporting passage is about **residents of *internaty*** (residential
  institutions) losing the right to work outside the institution in 1968, citing
  Anne White (1999:37) — whose evidence is residents' **correspondence**, not a decree.
- She **contradicts the broad reading two sentences later**: by 1988 ~30% of disabled
  people were employed, mostly "group III invalids" in ordinary jobs.
- **No independent corroboration exists.** No Soviet legal instrument, no Russian-language
  legal database, no disability-history scholarship, and no activist history asserts it.
  Claire Shaw's *Deaf in the USSR* (the deepest archival work on Soviet disabled
  employment) has 11 hits on "1968", none about an employment prohibition, and documents
  the opposite trajectory: movement *away from* segregated artels *toward* state industry.
  Rasell/Iarskaia-Smirnova describe employer **hiring quotas**, which a ban would preclude.

**Second pass (full text of Phillips recovered via reader proxy) refines this — separate the two claims:**

- **Narrow claim: SUPPORTED.** White 1999 p. 37 does state internat residents held the
  right to outside work "until 1968" and lost it. White's rationale is *not* Phillips's
  "administrative convenience" gloss but that "social security agencies seemingly found
  it difficult to reconcile the facts that disabled people both worked and received state
  support." **Cite White's mechanism, not Phillips's gloss.** A corresponding legal artifact
  exists: RSFSR Ministry of Social Security Order **N 179 of 31 December 1968** on
  internaty (confirmed via its 1978 successor, Prikaz N 145); the 1978 text provides only
  for work *inside* the institution. The 1968 text itself is not online.
- **Broad claim ("integrated employment was even forbidden"): NOT SUPPORTED.** Phillips's
  own supporting passage covers only internat residents, and she records ~30% of disabled
  people employed by 1988 in the same paragraph. Do not propagate.

Scale figures from Phillips, worth citing: **~220,000 people in over 4,000 artels** by the
late 1950s; VIKO appropriated by industrial ministries **1956–1960** and liquidated; a
statutory **2% employment quota that was not enforced**.

⚠️ **Hallucination caught during this pass.** An intermediate fetch produced a bibliography
entry reading "White, Anne (1999). *The Russian Devolution: An Amnesty Report on Disability...*
London: Amnesty International Publications." **No such title exists.** The real source is
Anne White, *Democratization in Russia under Gorbachev, 1985–91: The Birth of a Voluntary
Sector* (Macmillan/Springer), confirmed by three matching page-level snippets (pp. 35, 37, 45).
A plausible-looking fake citation appeared mid-verification — treat auto-generated
bibliography entries as unverified until the page is fetched.

### Corrections to the briefs' own framing

- **Tuskegee polio center vs. syphilis study** — the brief says "distinct from, but same campus." The syphilis study ran through the **same hospital** (John A. Andrew Memorial). "Same campus" reads as coincidence; it wasn't.
- **US→Nazi influence** — the textual model for the 1933 law was **Harry Laughlin's Model Eugenical Sterilization Law**, which Virginia's 1924 act also copied. Virginia was a sibling, not the parent.
- **T4 "halted 1941"** — children's euthanasia **never stopped**. Say so explicitly.
- **Peru** — 272,028 is the **Health Ministry's** figure for 1996–2001, not LUM's. "Over 7,000" is a **registry count**, not a victim total (Tamayo: only ~10% of 314,967 gave informed consent). **Newer than the brief:** the Inter-American Court ruled against Peru in *Celia Ramos v. Peru*, **March 2026**.
- **Russian institutionalized children** — brief's 400,000–600,000 is **all** children without parental care (611,034, 1997), not disabled children (~30,000, HRW 1998). Off by ~20×.
- **75/25 rural relationship is inverted** in the brief — 75/25 applied to **non-rural** areas; rural areas get a permanent 50/50 blend.
- **Willowbrook** — cite *NYSARC v. Carey*, 393 F. Supp. 715, not *Rockefeller*. Design capacity **~3,000**, not 4,000.
- **US polio survivor counts** — the "1 million / 433,000 NCHS" figure is **not** in the cited article and rests on 1980s–90s surveys. Mortality-adjusted, it overstates the living population by ~2–4×. Use the 1994–95 NHIS with its year plus a present-day range.

> **Standing gotcha:** take polio case counts from **GPEI Polio This Week**, not
> Emergency Committee statements — EC statements freeze counts at meeting date and
> materially undercount Afghanistan (44th EC reported 40 WPV1 for 2025 vs. a final 52).

> **Method warning from this pass:** on the South African claim, web searches
> returned confident confirmations phrased in near-verbatim query language, but
> fetching the cited pages showed the claim wasn't there — the search layer echoed
> the query back. Willowbrook's capacity figure and the Russian institutionalization
> number both appear to have propagated out of Wikipedia into apparent consensus.
> **Fetch the page; don't trust the snippet.**

## Statistics needing attribution (heatmap class #4)

These exist on the wiki and are **load-bearing** but were flagged as unsourced or
mangled. A *real* source likely exists — the fix is **attribute + caveat**, not
delete. Confirm the exact figure against the source before treating as ✅.

| Page area | Claim (as asserted) | Candidate primary source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

## Maintenance

- This ledger is **not published** (`published: false`) and is excluded from the
  link validator and the live build.
- When closing an AUDIT_RESULTS_* item that concerns a load-bearing fact, **add or
  update the row here** rather than leaving the fact only in the dated audit log.
- Pair with: [INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) (a wrong row here is a
  SEV1), `translation-source-accuracy-flags.md` (EN↔es sync), and the
  `disability-wiki-accuracy` skill (the verification discipline that fills it).
