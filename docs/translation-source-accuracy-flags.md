# Source-Accuracy Flags from Spanish Translation

These are potential **factual/legal errors or inconsistencies in the ENGLISH source**,
surfaced while translating pages to Spanish. Per the translation policy, the Spanish
was translated faithfully (carrying these over verbatim) and **no English file was
edited** — this list is for the maintainer's separate English-source review.

When you fix an item in English, also update the matching `es/` page so the two
languages stay in sync.

## ⚠️ ES SYNC REQUIRED (added 2026-06-07)

The Codex audit remediation (see `AUDIT_REMEDIATION_STATUS.md`) edited many **English** pages
this session. The corresponding **`es/` Spanish pages were NOT updated** and now carry the old,
incorrect content. Re-translate/sync these `es/` pages to match current English before relying
on them:

- ✅ `es/benefits/us/ssi.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** to Tier B English corrections (commit `71c8172`): SSI not taxable; cash gifts DO count as unearned income + $20 general income exclusion; in-kind food no longer counts (Sept 2024), shelter still can; resource exclusions = one vehicle (any value) + household goods, countable list fixed; SGA framed as application-stage test (not ongoing limit); noncitizen rules tightened; break-even ~$2,000 (was ~$1,200). On review the `es/` page already carried all corrections (translated in place earlier); re-verified line-by-line against current English and validated clean via `check_translation.py`.
- ✅ `es/benefits/us/medicare.md` — **VERIFIED SYNCED 2026-06-07**: 2026 figures ($202.90 Part B premium, $2,100 Part D cap, $1,736/$615 deductibles), donut-hole→cap, MA copay/referral, no unsourced Medigap ranges, bathroom equipment not covered — all already present and matching current EN; validated clean. *(Open EN flag to spot-check: Part B annual deductible $283.)*
- ✅ `es/benefits/us/veterans-benefits.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** to Tier C English corrections (commit `d4d8937`): caregiver stipend "varies (GS-4 locality/level)", clothing allowance "not automatic / VA Form 10-8678", TDRP "List-based, not a fixed term", Crisis Line "988 then press 1". On review the `es/` page already carried all four corrections (translated in place earlier); re-verified line-by-line against current English and validated clean via `check_translation.py`.
- ✅ `es/rights/us/ada.md`, `es/rights/us/section-504.md`, `es/rights/us/state-disability-rights-laws.md` — **VERIFIED SYNCED 2026-06-07**: ada (punitive damages NOT vs govt/Barnes v. Gorman, LGBTQ+ nuance/Williams v. Kincaid, 2024 DOJ Title II web rule Apr 2026/2027), section-504 (May 2026/2027 + July 2026 = one accessible unit per type, QALY ban, Cummings, §503 $20k), state-rights (CA DFEH→CRD all 3 spots; NY 1+ employees; Pennsylvania correctly 4+) — all already present/correct vs current EN; validated clean.
- ✅ `es/rights/us/air-carrier-access-act.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** to Tier C English correction (commit `d4d8937`): "Plazos" block now tracks DOT's actual wording — airline "not required to address a written complaint received more than 45 days after the incident (unless DOT refers it)"; "DOT refers the disability-related complaints it receives and reviews them; you can also complain directly to DOT (generally within 6 months)"; deleted the old "DOT investigates / airlines must respond to DOT inquiries" bullets; ACAA "no private right of action" retained. On review the `es/` page already carried the full correction (translated in place earlier); re-verified line-by-line against current English (no OLD-wording remnants) and validated clean via `check_translation.py`.
- ✅✅ **All edited crisis pages — SYNCED 2026-06-07.** `es/crisis/crisis-hotlines/{north-america/mexico,north-america/united-states,north-america/canada,asian-pacific/india,asian-pacific/indonesia,asian-pacific/philippines,asian-pacific/thailand,asian-pacific/australia,europe/united-kingdom}.md` and `es/crisis/abuse/abuse-resources.md` now match the Tier A English corrections (`d1f90c7`). All 9 leaf pages validate clean via `check_translation.py`.

**Life-safety priority — DONE.** The crisis-page `es/` versions previously showed wrong/obsolete numbers; all are now corrected: Mexico → Línea de la Vida 800-911-2000; Thailand 1300 → DMH 1323; India → adds Tele-MANAS 14416; Indonesia → Healing119 / 119 ext 8; Philippines → NCMH 1553; Australia → Lifeline "gratuito"; UK + abuse-resources → Rape & Sexual Abuse Support Line 0808 500 2222; US/Canada → 988 emergency-policy wording. Blanket "all free/confidential/24-7" footers and false "verified" lines softened to match EN.

> Note: the aggregator index `es/crisis/crisis-hotlines/asian-pacific.md` was checked — its Thailand "1300" is the **Baan Kredtrakarn child-abuse line** (a distinct, valid service), not the obsolete Samaritans number, so it correctly mirrors EN and needs no change.

**Remaining ES sync (next session):** the benefits/ and rights/ pages listed above (⬜) are NOT yet synced to their Tier B/C English corrections.

### ⚠️ ES SYNC — employment/ + education/ (added 2026-06-07, from cold slop-sweep fixes)
These English pages were corrected this session (commits `8fa5f04`, `1f98057`) and their `es/` counterparts are now stale:
- ✅ `es/employment/workplace-accommodations.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): §503 (federal contractors, $10k+) vs §504 (federal-fund recipients) de-conflated; JAN cost figures (~61% no-cost / ~$300 median); ESA case-by-case; legal-right hedge; frontmatter description. Validated clean. *(Open EN flag: confirm JAN 61%/$300 vs askjan.org.)*
- ✅ `es/employment/employment-rights-by-country.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): Spain LISMI → Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2013 (2% reservation, 50+ employees); CDPD "standard ≠ enforceable individual remedy" lead caveat; fixed CDPD gloss (dropped English convention name per glossary). Validated clean.
- ✅ `es/employment/job-searching-with-a-disability.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): vague "fewer callbacks" → Ameri et al. 2018 (*ILR Review*), ~26% fewer expressions of employer interest, with link. Validated clean.
- ✅ `es/education/higher-education.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): CDPD signing≠ratifying caveat (US signed 2009, never ratified; US rights from ADA/§504); frontmatter description. Validated clean.
- ✅ `es/education/k12-education.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): same CDPD signing≠ratifying caveat (US signed 2009; US rights from IDEA/§504). Validated clean.
- ✅ `es/benefits/index.md` — 2026 figures ($994/$1,690); one-vehicle exclusion; DAC age-22 clarification *(synced 2026-06-07, commit `7739db4`)*
- ✅ `es/benefits/poverty-and-benefits-trap.md` — 2026 SSI base; 1972/1989 reconciliation; inflation/proposed-limit correction *(synced 2026-06-07, commit `7739db4`)*
- ✅ `es/rights/filing-a-disability-complaint.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): OCR section was misrouting IDEA → now OCR = §504/Title II only with an explicit note it does NOT handle IDEA/IEP; added an IDEA complaint section (state complaint 1yr / due-process hearing 2yr, 34 CFR 300.153/300.507); fixed the SoL table; also repaired broken frontmatter description. Validated clean.
- ✅ `es/rights/international-rights.md` — **SYNCED 2026-06-07** (edited): CRPD count "191 firmaron / 190 ratificaron" → "más de 190 países han ratificado la CDPD o se han adherido a ella"; restored US "firmó en 2009"; CDPD acronym used. Validated clean. *(Open EN flag: Optional Protocol "107 ratified" may be stale + undated.)*

## benefits/ (category complete — 20 pages, June 2026)

### Dollar amounts / figures to verify against official 2026 sources
- ✅ `benefits/us/medicare.md` — Part B premium **$202.90**, Part D cap **$2,100**, Part A deductible **$1,736**, Part D deductible **$615**. Verified correct vs CMS 2026 (Codex audit). *(EN good; ES needs sync.)*
- ✅ `benefits/us/ssi.md` — SGA **$1,690/mo** and FBR **$994/mo** verified vs SSA (Codex audit). *(EN good; ES needs sync.)*
- ⬜ `benefits/us/veterans-benefits.md` — VA Pension income range "**~$17,400–$22,800**" may conflate **base** MAPR with **Aid & Attendance** MAPR (A&A is higher, ~$28k–$33k). Still open — check VA MAPR tables and clarify base vs A&A.
- ✅ `benefits/index.md` & `benefits/poverty-and-benefits-trap.md` — refreshed to 2026 (SSI base **$994**, SGA **$1,690**), verified vs SSA 2.8% COLA. Also fixed `index.md` "car up to certain value" → one vehicle (any value) and the DAC "before age 22" conflation. *(EN fixed 2026-06-07; ES needs sync.)*

### Internal inconsistencies (same page contradicts itself)
- ✅ `benefits/us/ssi.md` — the stale **~$1,200** break-even in "Common SSI Myths" was corrected this session (now ~$2,000, consistent with the income-exclusion math). *(EN fixed; ES needs sync.)*
- ✅ `benefits/poverty-and-benefits-trap.md` — reconciled the 1989-vs-1972 contradiction (limit dates to SSI's 1972 creation; current $2,000/$3,000 levels set 1989). Also corrected the inflation claim: "~$10,000" was the *proposed* SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act figure, not inflation-adjusted (>$5,000). *(EN fixed 2026-06-07; ES needs sync.)*

### Naming / outdated references
- ✅ `benefits/us/veterans-benefits.md` — TDRP wording corrected to **Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL)** framing this session. *(EN fixed; ES needs sync.)*
- ✅ `benefits/us/veterans-benefits.md` — Veterans Crisis Line updated to **dial 988 then press 1** (old 1-800-273-8255 noted as still routing). *(EN fixed this session; ES needs sync.)*
- ⬜ `benefits/us/veterans-benefits.md` — "available for life / continues as long as service-connected" slightly overstates; ratings can be reduced on re-exam unless protected. **Open.**
- ✅ `benefits/us/ssi.md` — "taxed as federal income assistance" → corrected to "SSI is **not** taxable income" this session. *(EN fixed; ES needs sync.)*

### Cosmetic link-text/href mismatches (href is correct; only displayed text is wrong)
- ⬜ `benefits/us/family-caregiver-pay.md` — link text shows `/benefits/us-benefits-overview`
  (hyphenated, not a real path); href is correct.
- ⬜ `benefits/us/medicaid.md` — link text shows `/benefits/us-ssi` and
  `/benefits/us-medicare` (hyphenated); hrefs are correct.
- ⬜ `benefits/index.md` & `benefits/poverty-and-benefits-trap.md` — mixed
  "Contribute" targets: some `/start/contribute`, some `/glossary/how-to-contribute`.
  Inconsistent but not broken.

### Checked — not an issue
- ⏭️ `benefits/international/benefits-overview.md` links to
  `/benefits/other-countries-benefits` — a translating agent suspected this was a dead
  link, but the source page **does exist** (`benefits/other-countries-benefits.md`).
  No action needed.
- ⏭️ `benefits/european-union/benefits.md` references `/benefits/eu/germany` etc. —
  these are inside code spans as aspirational placeholders, not live links.

## Anchor TOCs — Spanish jump-links (added 2026-06-07)

In-page "jump to section" TOCs were made to work in Spanish via explicit heading
IDs (`## Heading {#id}`, markdown-it-attrs) pinned to match the existing anchor
targets — accent-independent by construction. Done across all 51 non-crisis es/
pages that have TOCs. The 10 crisis-hotline index pages are pending (blocked by
the Norton write quarantine; finish with `pin_anchors.py` after the exclusion).

### ⬜ Dangling anchors — broken in the ENGLISH source too (TOC link points to an id no heading produces)
These were already dead links on the live English site; flag for an EN fix
(correct the anchor or the heading), then the es/ pinning will pick them up:
- `housing/*` (housing-rights, home-modifications, group-homes-and-institutions, homelessness-and-disability, independent-living-philosophy-and-centers, tenants-rights-with-disabilities, accessible-housing-search-guide): TOC link `#european-union` but heading is `## European Union & Member States` (real slug `european-union--member-states`); accessible-housing-search-guide also `#other-countries` vs `## Other Countries`.
- `sports/paralympic-movement`: TOC `#sports` — no heading slugs to "sports" (headings are "Summer/Winter Paralympic Sports").
- `rights/international-rights`: TOC `#united-nations-framework` — no matching heading slug.
- `history/pre-industrial`: TOC `#ejemplos-históricos-detallados` — no matching ES heading (section retitled in translation).

English commit `d5772e6` cleared the last 35 broken links (2 repoints + 4 new
pages, bringing the repo to 0 broken). Propagated to `es/`:

### ✅ Repoints applied to es/

- `es/healthcare/medical-gaslighting.md` — `/healthcare/understanding-medical-bias`→`/healthcare/medical-bias` (3 refs)

### ✅ New Spanish pages (translated from the English originals)
- `es/community/disability-specific-peer-groups.md` (org names/acronyms kept in English: ASAN, NAD, AADB, NFB, SABE, DBSA, NAMI, CommunicationFIRST, The Arc, Helen Keller National Center, Hearing Voices Network USA)
- `es/foundations/language-terminology-identity.md`
- `es/foundations/epistemic-injustice.md`
- `es/daily-living/mobility-aid-stigma.md`

All 7 files pass `check_translation.py`; all `/es/` cross-links resolve.

## ✅✅ employment/employment-rights-by-country.md synced (2026-06-07)

Synced `es/employment/employment-rights-by-country.md` to the audit-corrected English source. Two corrections applied:

1. **Lead caveat (CRPD/CDPD enforceability)** — added the sentence noting the CDPD sets an international standard whose individual enforceability depends on each country's national implementation. Also fixed the first-use CDPD gloss to the official Spanish name ("Convención sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad (CDPD)") rather than carrying the English convention name.
2. **Spain LISMI → RDL 1/2013** — replaced "La LISMI" with "La Ley General de derechos de las personas con discapacidad (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2013, que consolidó la antigua LISMI)" per current English.

Passes `check_translation.py`.
