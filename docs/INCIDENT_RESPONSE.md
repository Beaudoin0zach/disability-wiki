# Incident Response Runbook

What to do when disabilitywiki.org breaks. The site is a **static Astro Starlight
build on Cloudflare Pages** (project `disability-wiki`, root `site/`, auto-deploys
on merge to `main`). **Publishing = merge to main** — there is no human review
gate beyond [CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml), so a bad merge reaches the live
site within a Pages build cycle.

This is a **life-safety reference**: it carries crisis hotline numbers, benefits
dollar figures, and legal deadlines people act on. A wrong number is an incident,
not a typo. Treat content correctness with the same urgency as uptime.

Adapted from the `benefits-navigator` incident runbook for a static content site.

## Severity levels

| Severity | Description | Response | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **SEV1 — Critical** | Site down, **or** live content that can cause physical harm | Immediate | All-pages 5xx/DNS failure; a crisis/suicide hotline number that is wrong, dead, or misrouted; a benefits rule that would make someone lose eligibility |
| **SEV2 — High** | Major section broken or broadly-wrong content deployed; TLS/security failure | < 4 hours | A bad merge rewrote many pages; cert expired; whole section 404s; defacement |
| **SEV3 — Medium** | Single page broken, broken internal links, stale-but-not-dangerous facts | Next day | One page won't render; dead links; an outdated (not harmful) figure |
| **SEV4 — Low** | Cosmetic | Backlog | Emoji/heading style, minor layout |

**The SEV1 content test:** *would someone be physically or financially harmed by
acting on what the page says right now?* Crisis numbers, "call this in an
emergency" instructions, and eligibility-destroying benefits advice are SEV1. When
unsure, treat as SEV1 and verify.

---

## Rollback paths

**Content rollback (the rollback path): `git revert` + redeploy.**
Bad content or a broken build that merged to `main` — revert the merge commit on
`main`; Cloudflare Pages rebuilds and redeploys the corrected `main` automatically.
This is the right path for *almost every* incident.

```bash
git revert -m 1 <bad-merge-sha>   # -m 1 for a merge commit; drop it for a plain commit
git push origin main              # Pages redeploys main
```

You can also **roll back to a previous deployment** in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard
(Deployments → pick last-good → "Rollback to this deployment") for an instant revert
without waiting for a rebuild. Still land the `git revert` so `main` and the live
deploy agree.

> **No fallback origin (as of 2026-07-10).** The old Wiki.js droplet
> (`167.71.97.167`) was the platform-rollback fallback until it was
> **decommissioned on 2026-07-10** (migration Phase 5). There is no longer a server
> to point DNS at. If **Cloudflare Pages itself** is down (not a content/build bug),
> the only options are the Pages **dashboard deployment-rollback** and, if Pages is
> truly unservable, **Cloudflare support** — there is no origin to fail over to.

**Decision rule:** content/build problem → revert (above). Cloudflare Pages platform
outage → dashboard deployment-rollback, else Cloudflare support.

## Runbooks

### A crisis or hotline number is wrong, dead, or misrouted (SEV1)

This is the highest-stakes incident class — the fabricated-hotline pattern is a
known, recurring failure (the AI invented "Lifeline {Country}" orgs with plausible
numbers; a Vietnamese bank's customer line was listed as a mental-health hotline).
See the fact-check error heatmap in project memory.

1. **Confirm** the number is wrong by checking **two independent primary sources**
   (the operating org's official site + a government/health-ministry listing). Do
   not "fix" a correct number on one report.
2. **Fix English + Spanish together.** The `es/` page is a separate file with the
   same number; correct both (use the `disability-wiki-accuracy` and
   `spanish-wiki-translation` skills).
3. **Grep the wrong number sitewide before declaring it fixed.** Fabricated
   numbers propagate across overview + country pages + footers. The old SSI "car
   value" error had silently copied into `benefits/index.md`.
   ```bash
   grep -rn "<the wrong number>" . --include=*.md
   ```
4. **Merge to main**, let Pages deploy, then **verify the live page actually
   shows the fix** (see the Cloudflare-cache runbook — a `?v=` param does *not*
   bust the cache).
5. If the page can't be fixed within the SEV1 window, **unpublish or hedge** the
   specific number rather than leave a harmful one live.

### The site is down (all/most pages failing) (SEV1)

1. **Isolate the layer:**
   - `curl -sI https://disabilitywiki.org` — TLS + status. 5xx vs no-response.
   - Check **Cloudflare Pages dashboard** → project `disability-wiki` →
     Deployments: did the last deploy fail or succeed?
   - Check **Cloudflare DNS** for the zone: are the records still pointing at
     Pages (CNAME/Pages), or were they changed?
   - Check [cloudflarestatus.com](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/).
2. **If the last deploy failed/shipped a bad build** → **path 1**: revert the
   merge or roll back the deployment in the dashboard.
3. **If Cloudflare Pages itself is down** → there is no fallback origin (the droplet
   was decommissioned 2026-07-10). Try the dashboard deployment-rollback; if Pages is
   truly unservable, wait on Cloudflare / open a support ticket.
4. Communicate status (even to yourself: log start time, suspected cause).

### A bad merge shipped broadly-wrong content or defacement (SEV2)

1. **Revert first, diagnose second** (path 1): `git revert -m 1 <sha>` && push, or
   dashboard deployment-rollback for immediate effect.
2. Do **not** use the droplet to "restore" content — its content is frozen at the
   cutover and would itself be stale/wrong.
3. Once reverted, open the offending diff in a branch, fix properly, re-merge
   through CI.

### Cloudflare is serving a stale page after a fix

The DB/repo/build can be correct while the edge still serves the old HTML.

1. Verify the **origin** is correct first: check the built page or the source on
   `main`, not just `curl` of the public URL.
2. **Purge** in the Cloudflare dashboard (Caching → Purge → purge the specific
   URL, or Purge Everything if widespread).
3. A `?v=` / cache-buster query param **does not** bust Cloudflare's cache — don't
   rely on it to "prove" a fix.

### Cloudflare Pages build is failing

1. Read the **build log** in the Pages dashboard. Most failures are an Astro/
   Starlight content error (bad frontmatter YAML, a broken content reference).
2. Reproduce locally: `cd site && npm ci && npm run build`.
3. CI ([.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs this same
   build on every PR — a red CI check is the early warning. If a build broke on
   `main`, CI on the PR should have caught it; if it didn't, the gap is a
   follow-up.

### A merge did not publish — the live site is stale (SEV2, SEV1 if a crisis fix)

This HAS happened (2026-07-19: the GitHub→Pages trigger died silently; crisis
content fixes sat merged-but-unpublished for 4 days). "Publishing = merge to
main" is an assumption, not a law.

1. **Detection:** the `verify-live-deploy` CI job goes red on the merge — it
   polls the live `/ota/manifest.json` until it serves the merged commit's SHA
   with a valid signature. Manual check:
   `curl -s https://disabilitywiki.org/ota/manifest.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['gitSha'])"`
   vs `git rev-parse main`.
2. **Distinguish** trigger-dead vs build-failing:
   `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=39d7ced651572ee48cca6a29e1feebe9 npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name disability-wiki`
   — no new deployment rows at all = the Git trigger is dead; failed rows = read
   the build log (previous runbook).
3. **Rescue deploy** (restores the live site now, independent of the trigger):
   ```bash
   cd site && OTA_SIGNING_KEY=<from the key ceremony> npm run build && \
   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=39d7ced651572ee48cca6a29e1feebe9 npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name disability-wiki --branch main --commit-dirty=true
   ```
   Without `OTA_SIGNING_KEY` the site still publishes but the OTA manifest is
   unsigned — installed apps will refuse it until a signed deploy lands.
4. **Root cause:** dashboard → Pages → `disability-wiki` → Settings → Builds &
   deployments → Git integration (repo transfers and GitHub App permission
   changes are the classic silent killers). Re-connect, then push a trivial
   commit and watch `verify-live-deploy` go green.

## Post-incident

For any SEV1 or SEV2, write a short post-mortem (blameless — focus on the system,
not the person):

```
## Post-mortem: <title> (<date>)
- Severity: SEV<N>
- Duration: <detected> → <resolved>
- User impact: <who saw what, and the harm risk>
- Root cause: <what actually broke>
- Resolution: <what fixed it>
- Detection gap: <why we didn't catch it sooner — and the guardrail that closes it>
- Follow-ups: <issues/PRs>
```

**If the lesson transfers to other projects** (a Cloudflare-cache gotcha, a
deploy-gate gap, a content-verification miss), capture it with **`/lesson`** so it
lands in `~/.claude/shared/LESSONS.md` and reaches crip-chronicle and the other
sites. Project-specific facts stay in this repo's memory.
