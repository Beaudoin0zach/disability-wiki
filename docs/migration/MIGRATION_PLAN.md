# Migration Plan: Wiki.js → Astro Starlight on Cloudflare Pages

Decided 2026-06-11. Framework: **Astro Starlight**. Hosting: **Cloudflare Pages**
(DNS already on Cloudflare). Repo: **this repo**, site scaffolding under `site/`,
content stays in place.

**Why:** the workflow is already git-first (contributions arrive by email, not wiki
accounts); Wiki.js 2.x is frozen (3.0 announced 2021, still no beta in 2026); the
DB/sync layer has caused repeated operational pain (half-imports, wedged rebases,
non-content page leaks). A static build makes "merge to main" = "published" and
retires the droplet (~$150+/yr).

## Phases

- **Phase 0 — Export DB-only state** ✅ done 2026-06-11, artifacts in this folder
- **Phase 1 — Scaffold**: `site/` with Starlight; en at root, es under `/es/`
  (URLs unchanged); content collections read existing dirs in place; frontmatter
  schema tolerates Wiki.js fields; `lastUpdated` from git
- **Phase 2 — Parity**: sidebar from `nav-export.json`; Pagefind search (en+es);
  `_redirects` (orphans + trailing-slash variants); 404, robots, sitemap; light
  theme (logo: `logo.png` here; site title/description: `site-config.json`)
- **Phase 3 — Verification**: build-time broken-link failure; URL-set diff vs
  live sitemap (every URL 200/301); es↔en switcher round-trip on all page pairs;
  axe accessibility audit; visual spot-check of ~20 high-stakes pages
- **Phase 4 — Parallel run + cutover** ✅ **CUTOVER COMPLETE 2026-06-12**:
  Cloudflare Pages project `disability-wiki` (git-connected to `main`, root dir
  `site/`, `NODE_VERSION=22`, auto-deploys on merge; preview
  https://disability-wiki.pages.dev). Custom domains disabilitywiki.org + www
  attached; verified live: 200s both locales, `/en/*` 301s, stub/index/case
  redirects, 404, TLS. **Publishing = merge to main.** A phantom
  `disability-wiki` submodule gitlink had to be removed for Cloudflare's clone.
  **Rollback** (until Phase 5): restore the A records to 167.71.97.167.
- **Phase 5 — Decommission** — **scheduled 2026-07-10** (Claude scheduled task
  `droplet-decommission-day`): health-check static site → final droplet backup
  archived locally (incl. docker-compose.yml + .env, gitignored) → Zach destroys
  droplet in DigitalOcean → DNS cleanup (delete remaining A records incl. the
  DNS-only `sitemap-*`; confirm DMARC `_dmarc` TXT) → rewrite claude.md +
  `disability-wiki-edit` skill for merge-to-main; CHANGELOG + memory updates

## Phase 0 findings (2026-06-11)

- **Nav**: single `en` tree, 182 items / 21 section headers → `nav-export.json`
- **Site config**: no analytics configured; default theme; title/description/logo
  → `site-config.json`, `logo.png`
- **DB↔repo reconciliation** (`page-reconciliation.json`): 570 DB pages vs 546
  repo files reconcile to **3** published DB-only pages:
  - `foundations/welcome` — in nav → **exported to repo** ✅
  - `crisis/emergency-disaster-preparedness` — in nav → **exported to repo** ✅
  - `regions/index` — empty section, no inbound links/nav → **drop + redirect to `/`**
  - 13 unpublished DB leftovers (leaked internal docs, archetypes) → drop
- **Repo case-duplicate dir**: both `rights/` and `Rights/` exist in the repo
  (DB merges them case-insensitively). Must be merged into lowercase `rights/`
  during Phase 1 — Cloudflare Pages serving is case-sensitive.
- **Content is pure GFM**: zero Wiki.js-specific markdown extensions repo-wide.
- **Live sitemap**: Wiki.js serves no sitemap.xml (0 locs) — the Phase 3 URL
  inventory must come from the DB page list (`pages{list}`) instead; Starlight
  adds a real sitemap, a small SEO gain.

## Post-cutover notes (2026-06-12 →)

- The Wiki.js sync/sweep cautions are obsolete: the public site no longer reads
  from Wiki.js. The droplet still pulls `main` into its local clone until it is
  destroyed — harmless and unreachable publicly.
- Do not restructure content paths: URL preservation is the SEO and
  link-integrity guarantee (`/en/*` 301s + generated alias redirects cover the
  legacy URL space).
- Open items until Phase 5: ~~delete stale `sitemap-*` DNS-only A record~~ (done
  2026-06-12); add DMARC (`_dmarc` TXT, `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine;
  rua=mailto:<owner>`); PR #23 (substance-use page) awaiting content review.
